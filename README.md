# ToDo
Functional To Do website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This website allows the user to help organise their tasks, adding new ones and deleting them. In this way, the user will be able to see all their tasks.

We have used Node.js to view the rendered website and interact with it.

There are 5 distinct components:
- Status
- Search engine
- List of tasks
- Task form
- Categories
